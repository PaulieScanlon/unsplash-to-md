Took a few days to pull this shot off. It was all about the setup. We used a giant piece of foam board maybe 8’x8’ and then cut a 12”x12” circle in the center. Then, we placed a 700W Softbox Light behind the foam board so the light only shined through the circle. Some camera adjustments and the shot was perfect. My head wasn’t the first choice for the photo but it ended up being the most interesting silhouette.
